This is my first project about data analytics. 
This project is about to predict a man who will be likely to survive in a Titanic Disaster.
I learnt how to read the data as well as build machine learning models through a tutorial on [CodeXplore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQvO_CIFPA&list=PLJcWUrckOCKKwjjHALg6fnyQCHv8z92rs&index=8 "Youtube")
